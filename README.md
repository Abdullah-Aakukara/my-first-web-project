# My First Web Project

📅 Created in 2023 — My First GitHub Repo

This was the very first project I ever pushed to GitHub during my first year of Computer Science.

I created this simple webpage in **2023**, when I had just started exploring **HTML and web development**. It was a small step, but an important one — learning to write basic tags, create buttons, and publish code for the first time.

## 💡 Why I Keep This Repo

This repo reminds me how far I’ve come.  
It represents the beginning of my coding journey — from raw HTML in 2023 to now learning Full Stack Development.

## ✅ What You'll Find

- A basic `index.html` page
- No fancy UI or logic — just raw curiosity
- Proof that *everyone starts somewhere*

## 📌 Where I Am Now

Today, I'm:
- A Final Year CS Student (2025)
- Learning **Backend Development** (Node.js, Express, PostgreSQL)
- Aiming to become an **AI Engineer**
- Top 50 Finalist – *Codecademy World Coding Games 2024*

🛤️ I don’t actively update this repo, but I proudly keep it to show where my journey started.
